Some of the indetation was off, so the I corrected and it made the open and closeing make more sense. Also with the indentation, I moved moved the Head tag over a space so it couild stand out a little more. 
I reduced the line space of the link in the in the head section. Don't know if this changes anything. Just looks cleaner. 
There were also some div, Unordered list and list tags that did not have the clsoing tag. I closed those tags.
